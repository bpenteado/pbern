        <p class="title"><b>Another ride at the running circus</b><br><i>Macrocycles, Patagonia, and learnings of a deluded amateur</i></p>

        <p>I’m taking another ride at the running circus. I promised I’d retire after <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/6923788302/overview">Paris</a> but Bekele convinced me that <a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/kenenisa-bekele-marathon-paris-2024-exclusive">retirement is an indefinitely moving goalpost</a>.</p>
        
        <p>I’m turning 29 in a few weeks. This project was born from a sneaky urge to squeeze the final drops of my prime years as an amateur athlete.</p>

        <p>But I’ve decided to do things differently this time.</p>

        <p>A laid-back 1-year macrocycle instead of erratic, rigorous 12-16 week sprints.</p>

        <p>A mix of trail and road instead of the monotonous grind on concrete.</p>

        <p>A navigation of the distance spectrum, instead of stubborn replays of a Daniels plan.</p>

        <p><a href="#projects">Projects</a> instead of target workouts.</p>

        <p>We’re not all cut out for the <a href="http://www.mariusbakken.com/the-norwegian-model.html">Norwegian Model</a>, <a href="https://www.trailrunnermag.com/training/trail-tips-training/the-wildly-cool-training-approach-of-speed-skating-gold-medalist-nils-van-der-poel/">Van der Poel’s herculean aerobic training</a>, or <a href="https://www.kilianjornet.cat/en/training">Kilian’s day-long offseason outings</a>.</p>

        <p>So I’ll use this project to share unsolicited learnings of what’s worked for a lowly amateur athlete (for performance and, most importantly, enjoyment purposes).</p>

        <p>I'm opening up my <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/1476449">Strava</a> and training data and will be sharing my research, projects, and private training logs going forward.</p>

        <br>

        <p class="title" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;"><b>≑ Goal Events: Patagonia Run (110k), Amsterdam Marathon (2:19:59)</b></p>

        <p>I have yet to reach enlightenment - I can’t hide the fact that I still care about numbers.</p>

        <p>So I’m anchoring this final ride on the holy grail of amateur running: a sub 2:20 marathon in Amsterdam (October 2025).</p>

        <p>I’ll also swing for a 110k (D+ 6,020m) at the <a href="https://www.patagoniarun.com/en/">Patagonia Run</a> in San Martín de Los Andes (April 2025). The perfect ultramarathon debut opportunity: pairing beautiful scenery with a strong aerobic build for Amsterdam.</p>
        
        <br>

        <p class="title" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;"><b>≑ Structuring the macrocycle</b>

        <p style="margin: 0;">The principles for structuring the macrocycle are simple:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc; padding: 0 5%; margin: 10px auto;">
            <li>3-4 week training blocks (with enough rest between blocks)</li>
            <li>Mesocycles of 2-4 blocks (each focusing on a very specific training vector)</li>
            <li>One 2-week reset (after first goal event)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <img style="margin: 10px auto;" class ="logo" src= "assets/images/macrocycle.png">

        <p>My bet for this project is that I'll be able to reach sub-2:20 marathon fitness with a focus on pushing my aerobic (not lactate!) threshold higher, hence the importance of the 3rd mesocycle and the Patagonia 110k<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>.</p>

        <p style="margin: 0;">With that being said, each of the mesocycles will focus on a specific training stimulus:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: upper-roman; padding: 0 5%; margin: 10px auto;">
            <li><strong>Threshold (race-specific: <a href="https://worldtrailraces.com.br/etapa/wtr-serra-do-mar/">WTR Serra do Mar</a> | 16km, D+ 872m)</strong>: ease back into consistent training after <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/12466932178">UTMB Paraty</a>, riding some mid-distance fitness into a fun race. Varied training (road/trail, endurance/threshold/fartleks) with significant uphill volume, mimicking the Paraty build. Focus on strengthening and weight loss (6-7 pounds off racing target).</li>
            <li><strong>VO2max and anaerobic</strong>: focus on top-end speed work pushing VO2max higher, improving leg turnover, and working on running mechanics. Lower volume with lots of intensity.</li>
            <li><strong>Aerobic (race-specific: Patagonia Run 110k)</strong>: probably the most important mesocycle of the macrocycle (more on this below). Time to build a big aerobic engine and ignite the mitochondria factory. We will likely sprinkle in one or two bouts of low-intensity overreaching. Lots of time in the mountains.</li>
            <li><strong>Threshold and VO2max</strong>: I'm still not sure how to best ride the aerobic boost from Patagonia into Amsterdam. I'll probably want to avoid too much volume and focus on adding back intensity. It will be winter in Brazil, so probably a good time for short-to-mid distance PRs (5k through 21k) and "attack" projects in the mountains.</li>
            <li><strong>Marathon (race-specific: Amsterdam Marathon)</strong>: the classic build. 16 weeks is probably the limit for a marathon cycle. I did 20 weeks for Paris and burned out 4 weeks before the race. 16 weeks is enough for 4-5 weeks with lots of aerobic volume followed by increased marathon specificity.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <ul style="list-style: decimal; padding: 0 0; margin: 0 0; font-size: 70%" id="note1">
            <li>
                <p>I am guilty of running my easy days fast, so this is motivated by the case of Scott Johnston, a former top US Cross Country skier (as seen in the book <i>Training for the Uphill Athlete: A Manual for Mountain Runners and Ski Mountaineers</i>).</p>
                <p>Scott underindexed his training on true aerobic effort (below AeT) so, despite his very impressive VO2max of 90 ml/kg/min, his progression stagnated because of ADS (Aerobic Deficiency Syndrome).</p>
                <p>He fixed his training, dropped his AeT pace from 5:16 min/km (8:30 min/mile) to 3:53 min/km (6:15 min/mile) with a corresponding HR increase from 135bpm to 158bpm, and finally qualified for the 2014 Olympic team.</p>
                <p>Run your easy days easy, kids!</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="title" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;"><b>≑ Core Principles</b>

        <ul style="list-style: disc; padding: 0 2.5%;">
            <li><strong>Pull the plug if things get off track</strong>: I won't hesitate to shelve this project if the enjoyment is gone or if it begins to chip away at my energy and free time with dear ones. Running is not my priority nor my job.</li>
            <li><strong>Play unreasonably conservative</strong>: the purpose of doing a year-long macrocycle is to go slow, gradually, with patience. No innovative workouts, no fixation on lap paces, extra dose of recovery.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan around projects</strong>: training plans set a general direction. They will be improvised as often as possible to accomodate projects.</li>
            <li><strong>Respect seasoned wisdom</strong>: for the first time, I’ve decided to train under the wing of a wiser runner. I admire <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mlmixrun/">Manuel Lago</a> as a student of science, a long-lived athlete, and a great friend. He’s the first one to call out bullshit, complexity, and inflated egos. Much needed checks and balances.</li>
        </ul>

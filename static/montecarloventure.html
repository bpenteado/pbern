        <p><label for="mn-figure-1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-figure-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><img src="../assets/images/babel.png" alt="Library of Babel"/><a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/172366.The_Library_of_Babel">Jorge Luis Borges, “The Library of Babel”</a></span>In <em>The Library of Babel</em>, Jorge Luis Borges introduces the idea of a universal library containing all possible permutations of a set of characters that can fit into 410 pages. Naturally, most books in this library consist of nothing more than unintelligible gibberish. However, hidden inside the vast honeycomb of hexagonal rooms lie a perfect replica of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, directions to the undiscovered tomb of Ramses VIII, and even a prophetical biography of one's still unfinished life.</p>
        <p>There is an oft-ignored parallel between <em>The Library of Babel</em> and venture capital as an asset class. It lies not in the fact that final outcomes (books or venture returns) are a product of random processes (a permutation of characters or the hackneyed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">"monkeys on typewriters"</a> hypothesis of venture returns), but in the fact that processes are not optimized to achieve an outcome that is ultimately desirable.</p>
        <p>Much like the scribes of the universal library, who write with the intention of producing random permutations instead of intelligible masterpieces, most venture capitalists intuitively invest with the blind goal of maximizing fund returns, instead of deliberately optimizing for the relevant production function of their craft.</p>
        <p>There are two main ideas at play here. First, is the idea that few investors fully grasp the mechanisms through which the levers of an investment strategy dictate fund returns. Second, is the more subjective idea that the venture capital production function is commonly misunderstood.</p>
        <p>In this essay, we will first argue that the venture capital production function should be to maximize the likelihood of raising a subsequent fund, instead of simply maximizing fund returns. Based on this idea, we will then use <em>Monte Carlo</em> statistical methods to analyze how portfolio composition decisions (check size, stage composition, portfolio size) affect probabilistic outcomes at the fund level.</p>
        <p>Our goal is not to identify "winning strategies", but to introduce a different framework for thinking about investment performance. Ultimately, early-stage investors should be able to think for themselves. Textbook rules do not work in a world of nuance. As we will see, the success of an investment strategy is heavily dependent on context. Unsurprisingly, unconventional strategies are most likely to produce alpha - in venture as well as in other walks of life.</p>
